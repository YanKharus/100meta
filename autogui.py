""" at this time responsible for getting player names
how am i going to go about developing this
    I need either standardized positions or to just make up placeholders and just build up the skeleton then worry about

    I guess I can hold all the images on my laptop its only 9 images and a text document a day

    should be fine 
making sure this makes sense when its a scheduled task
